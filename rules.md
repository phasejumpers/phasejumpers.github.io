## Colonization Contract (Code of Conduct)

1. Be kind to one another, first and foremost, in all things.

2. Don't be discriminatory. This includes transphobia, racism, and more. The Company prides itself on being inclusive to all.

3. Respect someone's identity and pronouns. This goes with rule 2.

4. No threatening people IRL, for any reason. The Company sees this as a liability, and frankly it's a bit rude.

5. You are responsible for renewing this contract as it changes, and are advised that ignorance of any contract changes is not an excuse for breaking them.

6. Do not post any shock or offensive content, including gore or animal cruelty, or any other content that could reflect badly on The Company. Furthermore, colonists are requested to please spoiler flashing images for the photosensitive members of our community.

7. Do not be the reason this contract is updated.

## Server Laws:

1. There is to be no combat or other war-related activities unless consented to by both parties. This includes so-called "warning shots", hostile tracking drones, building in another person's territory, and other activities.

2. Colonists are permitted to establish No-Fly Zones around their major outposts and any stationary mobile bases, as long as they are appropriately marked with signals or broadcast controllers. If you disrespect this zone and are shot, it is not considered an act of war. These zones have a maximum range of 5km. However, two No-Fly zones are not permitted within close proximity to each other (10km). If in doubt, the older No-Fly Zone stands. 

3. Keep the length of all colonist creations under 800 meters long. If you need to go longer, consider spitting the build in half and using drones or connectors instead.

4. Keep your parts usage reasonable. The Company prides efficiency in all things, and has granted all colonists access to special blueprints for more efficient Refineries, Assemblers, and H202 Generators, as well as larger Cargo Containers. This helps prevent cases of Lowe Sim's Speed.

5. Given the large amounts of radiation that can be produced by Megawelders, we request you please alert all other colonists before using them, as while the radiation is not lethal, it can cause a feeling of "slowness" or "stuttering", often referred to as "Lowe Sim's Speed".

6. To comply with Company regulations, please keep your construction platform detached from your main base, on a separate grid. This also helps reduce causes of Lowe Sim's Speed. 

7. Certain programs are not permitted while you are working with the company. Please do not use any of the following programs:

    {: .box-warning}
    Whip's turret based radar systems.  
    Whip's door.  
    AutoLCD.  
    LAMP and WAMP.  
    Blarmode's Fancy Flight Info.  
    Automatic LCDs 2 - By MMaster.  
    Whip's Artificial Horizon.  
    

8. So-called Gunbricks and similar creations reflect poorly on The Company, and are not permitted. If you are concerned if your creation counts as a Gunbrick, please consult your other colonists and the legal department at #Gunbrick-discussion.

9. Please remember that public coms in the system are still subject to the contract, and will be treated the same if you violate those rules.

## Coms Nomenclature

This system has two types of coms networks. The DISCORD system, and the radio coms network. The DISCORD system is used for long term, long form communication, while the radio coms are used for shorter form conversations. Think of it as the difference between emails and texting.

### DISCORD System

The DISCORD system has three main modes of operation.

BROADCAST: You are sending a message to everyone in the system who will listen. Useful for announcements or other major events.

TRANSMISSION: You are sending a message to someone specific. This does not mean the com is private. You will probably use this the most often.

DM-ENCRYP-2219: You have sent a private encrypted com to someone off the public network. This message is well and truely private, unless someone leaks the contents.

Keep in mind the bandwidth is shared, so you should limit use of the BROADCAST mode. If you'd like to advertise, band 88, #Faction-ads or 89, #Possible-news-articles, would be a better place to do so, as that band is opt-in.

### Radio Coms

The radio coms are much faster, chattier forms of communication. They can be heard system-wide, and use the same coms network as the DISCORD system. It too operates in three modes.

Public (/g): Sending messages to everyone. 

Faction (/f): A private band for inter-faction communication. 

Direct (/w): Direct radio between two players.

Most of the time you'll be using public coms for general chatter.
